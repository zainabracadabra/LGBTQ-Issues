    <p>Up to 40% of the 4.2 million youth experiencing homelessness identify as LGBTQ+, despite being only 9.5% of the U.S. population. Family rejection is the primary cause of homelessness of LGBTQ+ youth. Other reasons may stem from “aging out” of the foster care system at 18, poverty, and shortages of shelters and housing programs. While homeless, LGBTQ+ youth are more likely to experience assault, trauma, depression, and suicide compared to the homeless non-LGBTQ+ populations. Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) LGBTQ+ populations, who suffer from racial inequities and discrimination, have an even higher risk of homelessness.
