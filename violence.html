  <h1 style="text-align:left">Sexual Violence</h1>
  <p> Compared to heterosexual women, bisexual women have a higher prevalence of rape, physical violence, and stalking. Lesbian and gay men also reported higher levels of intimate partner violence and sexual violence when compared to heterosexual relationships. Many LGBTQ survivors of sexual assault are hesistant to seek for help from the police, hospitals, shelters or rape crisis centers due to their identities and the discrimination that may follow. </p>
  <h1 style="text-align:right">Suicidal Thoughts and Actions</h1>
  <p class = "blue">LGBTQ+ teenagers in states with transphobic and homophobic policies were more likely to attempt suicide than those in states with inclusive policies, as shown by <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34427167/">this 2021 study</a>.  The CDC released data that one in five LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in last year prior to taking the survey in March. The “Don’t Say Gay” Bill and other anti-LGBTQ+ legislation only exacerbate these consequences for queer youth. Transitioning and acceptance has been proved to alleviate poor mental health that otherwise may lead LGBTQ+ youth to contemplating or taking their life.
